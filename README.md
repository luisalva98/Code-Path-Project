### App Description
// TODO: Shows you underground resturants depending on your location. Users could give ratings. Follow food reviewers who use the app. 

### App Idea Evaluation
// TODO: Underground resturant reviews where you can also follow people, becoming a social media food app. 

- Mobile: Location based and map based shows users how to get to the resturant. 
- Story: Creates realtionship those who love to eat. Very clear values new places to eat where you wouldn't otherwise.
- Market: This market is in existence and it is a big market. This app would be more valuable to food enthusiast who want to try new things. Anyone can use it all ranges of age. From teens to adults. 
- Habit: People who go out to eat could potentially use the app everyday. People are always going to eat. Something that can be used everyday. 
- Scope: This app could be challenging because of location based maybe even use an API. This app could evolve from finding food to connecting with people. I think this app stripped down would still be interesting to build because of the different tools we would have to use.
